            <description>As we bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to reflect on the lessons learned, both good and challenging, and prepare for the opportunities ahead. Not everything went as planned, but each experience has been a stepping stone toward growth. Intelligence, after all, evolves through adaptation, and 2024 was undeniably a year where Artificial Intelligence (AI) took center stage.
Looking ahead, 2025 promises to bring more focused implementation, balancing AI advancements with broader digital modernization efforts.</description>

            <description>In our day-to-day work, we often create methods, processes, approaches, or features to address specific needs and challenges. Sometimes, these solutions turn into significant innovations, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t immediately recognize them as such. This is also true in our professional work setup, where we may invent without fully realizing it.
I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to share that a new patent has been granted to Lenovo for their groundbreaking work in the ThinkReality XR product line, and I am honored to be a co-inventor on this work.</description>
