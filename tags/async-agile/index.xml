            <description>As we bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to reflect on the lessons learned, both good and challenging, and prepare for the opportunities ahead. Not everything went as planned, but each experience has been a stepping stone toward growth. Intelligence, after all, evolves through adaptation, and 2024 was undeniably a year where Artificial Intelligence (AI) took center stage.
Looking ahead, 2025 promises to bring more focused implementation, balancing AI advancements with broader digital modernization efforts.</description>

            <description>As we say goodbye to 2023 and welcome 2024, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to think about the good and tough parts of the year. Not everything goes the way we want, but we can learn from both the good and bad experiences. I see 2023 as a year of making things better, like fixing the base of a building. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked my top five observations on foundational changes from this year, and some might continue into 2024.</description>
