            <description>The third industrial revolution gave birth to the digital webâ€”a new era of global connectivity and digital intelligence. My book Exploring the Metaverse, covers it and explore what comes next. As we now step into an AI-driven world, we must ask: where are we truly heading, and how ready are we?
Transformation requires us to evolveâ€”from traditional methods to newer, more adaptive approaches. While the digital era has been around for decades, many industries still struggle with achieving meaningful digital transformation.</description>

            <description>Product management is a unique blend of art and science, distinct from roles such as project management, program management, business analysis, or business development. Some projects or products may have dedicated product managers, but I believe these skills are valuable for various roles, even if not explicitly labeled as a product manager. Even technologists can benefit from these skills to enhance the value of their work.
This is where Dinker Charak&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;Product Management Untangled&amp;rsquo; becomes essential.</description>
