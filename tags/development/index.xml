            <description>As we close 2025 and step into 2026, this moment offers more than a calendar transition—it offers clarity. The past year tested assumptions, accelerated adoption, and forced recalibration across technology, business, and society.
For me personally, 2025 was a milestone year. After reflecting on two decades in the industry, I published my second book, Jagjeevan: Living Larger Than Life, in both Hindi and English, while continuing to engage readers through Exploring the Metaverse.</description>

            <title>A Path to AI → GenAI → Agentic AI</title>

            <description>The world of technology is evolving at lightning speed. Every week, new AI models, frameworks, and services make headlines. With the hype around LLMs, Agentic AI, MCPs, and A2A systems, it’s easy to feel like we’re always playing catch-up.
But here’s the truth: without strong fundamentals, chasing the “next big thing” is like building a skyscraper on sand. A strong foundation ensures stability. That’s why, before diving deep into Generative AI, it’s critical to revisit the path that got us here.</description>

            <title>FOMO to Flow: Building Gen AI Solutions</title>

            <description>Unlock the power of Generative AI by learning to interact with large language models programmatically—and take it further with fine-tuning for customized responses.
If you’re a software maker feeling the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the Gen AI revolution, you’re not alone. The way we build and interact with software is evolving rapidly. “Google it” or “check Stack Overflow” is no longer the go-to approach — AI-first, conversational tools are becoming the new standard across development, design, and decision-making.</description>

            <description>As we bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025, it’s a perfect moment to reflect on the lessons this year has offered—both rewarding and challenging—and to prepare for the opportunities ahead.
This year marked a significant milestone as I celebrated 20 years in the industry. Along this journey, I shared my experiences by publishing a book, contributing over 30 articles and whitepapers on topics like the AI-powered metaverse, IoT, D&amp;amp;Iand product management.</description>

            <description>AI is transforming the software development process, but there are many misconceptions about its capabilities. This article explores the common myths surrounding AI in software development and sheds light on its reality.
In recent times, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained momentum across various fields, especially with the introduction of Generative AI (GenAI). AI is now widely accessible, often sparking discussions about its potential, its misuse, and, unfortunately, several myths. As the hype around AI intensifies, so does the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), leading many to adopt it without fully understanding its true value.</description>

            <description>As we say goodbye to 2023 and welcome 2024, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to think about the good and tough parts of the year. Not everything goes the way we want, but we can learn from both the good and bad experiences. I see 2023 as a year of making things better, like fixing the base of a building. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked my top five observations on foundational changes from this year, and some might continue into 2024.</description>

            <description>Every end is a beginning, if there is no end, then there is no beginning, just like the year 2023 can only start after the end of year 2022. So this is the right time to reflect and plan for a better beginning. A “Forward Looking Reflection” was my topic of a guest lecture at DesignersX at their year end event. We discussed challenges of software development, and how the industry is trying to solve them.</description>

            <description>Sep 2020, a year ago, I was excited for getting nominated for an year long Global Leadership Development Program at Thoughtworks. At the same time was little confused on what we are going to do in this program for that long. I must say it was so well executed, despite the challenges of Covid#19, where we all(participants, speakers, coaches and other enablers) are globally distributed working from their home. Expectations were set, virtual meetings were set with options to attend at per individual comfort.</description>
