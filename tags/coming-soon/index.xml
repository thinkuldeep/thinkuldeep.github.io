            <description>Life teaches us lessons every single moment—but only when we pause to reflect do we truly grow. Everyone faces challenges; no life is free from problems. What defines us is not the struggle, but how we rise above it.
 Most challenges we encounter today are the same ones our previous generations faced—whether they relate to daily life, relationships, earning, spending, or navigating responsibilities. So much wisdom already exists around us, in our homes, in our traditions, in the stories of our elders.</description>

            <description>Product management is a unique blend of art and science, distinct from roles such as project management, program management, business analysis, or business development. Some projects or products may have dedicated product managers, but I believe these skills are valuable for various roles, even if not explicitly labeled as a product manager. Even technologists can benefit from these skills to enhance the value of their work.
This is where Dinker Charak&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;lsquo;Product Management Untangled&amp;rsquo; becomes essential.</description>

            <description>In the world of tech buzzwords, “metaverse” has been topic of discussion, largely understood and misunderstood. It comes, goes, and comes again in new shapes and forms, definitions and understanding. The term has been around for three decades and is poised to continue its evolution.
In the past, it has been defined to suit the narratives of organizations and individuals alike. Some see it as a game, others as a virtual world, while some view it as a tool for global connection and collaboration.</description>
