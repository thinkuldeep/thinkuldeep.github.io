            <description>This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It also includes the papers published in various conferences and journals.
 ITU-T Technical Report - Potential requirements of IoT-based Perishable Goods Monitoring System ITU-T Study Group 20 accepted my recommendation as a Technical Report. It defines key layers for IoT-based retail monitoring systems — including Sensing, Communication, Integration, Application &amp;amp; Analytics, and Management &amp;amp; Maintenance layers.</description>

            <description>💡 Innovation often starts with solving everyday problems. While working on XR solutions and building operating systems for smart glasses, we solved one such challenge.
Earlier, with our patented AppSpace method, we enabled rendering a phone’s 2D apps in 3D on smart glasses. But we found a gap — there was no direct way for a 2D app (like Chrome) to interact with 3D spatial content.
🏅 Thrilled to share that our solution to this is now recognized with a U.</description>

            <description>💡 Innovation Often Begins with Solving Everyday Problems
In our daily work, we regularly develop methods, processes, features, or approaches to address specific challenges. While these may initially seem like routine solutions, some of them quietly evolve into true innovations—often without us realizing it at the time.
🏅 I’m excited to share that one such innovation has now been recognized with a U.S. Patent!
Patent No : US 12,323,679 B2 This patent, titled _&amp;ldquo;Streaming of Composite Alpha Blended AR/MR Video&amp;rdquo; granted to Lenovo, introduces a novel method for web-based AR and MR streaming—allowing mixed reality experiences from a headset to be cast directly to a web browser, along with the phone screen.</description>

            <description>In our day-to-day work, we often create methods, processes, approaches, or features to address specific needs and challenges. Sometimes, these solutions turn into significant innovations, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t immediately recognize them as such. This is also true in our professional work setup, where we may invent without fully realizing it.
I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to share that a new patent has been granted to Lenovo for their groundbreaking work in the ThinkReality XR product line, and I am honored to be a co-inventor on this work.</description>

            <description>Every end is a beginning, if there is no end, then there is no beginning, just like the year 2023 can only start after the end of year 2022. So this is the right time to reflect and plan for a better beginning. A “Forward Looking Reflection” was my topic of a guest lecture at DesignersX at their year end event. We discussed challenges of software development, and how the industry is trying to solve them.</description>

            <description>The book &amp;ldquo;Agile IT Organization Design - For digital transformation and continuous delivery&amp;rdquo; by Sriram Narayan explains software development as a design process. Following statement from the book means a lot.
 &amp;ldquo;Software development is a design process, and the production environment is the factory where product takes place. IT OPS work to keep the factory running..&amp;rdquo;
 It questions the way we traditionally think of operation support, maintenance, production bugs, rework, their costs and budgets and the focus in software development life.</description>
