            <description>As we bid farewell to 2024 and welcome 2025, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to reflect on the lessons learned, both good and challenging, and prepare for the opportunities ahead. Not everything went as planned, but each experience has been a stepping stone toward growth. Intelligence, after all, evolves through adaptation, and 2024 was undeniably a year where Artificial Intelligence (AI) took center stage.
Looking ahead, 2025 promises to bring more focused implementation, balancing AI advancements with broader digital modernization efforts.</description>

            <description>Welcome to Internet 3.0, a transformative era where reality takes on new dimensions, driven by eXtended Reality (XR) at its core, along with AI, Cloud, IoT, and more. This evolution is the product of collaborative efforts involving academia, government, industry, and individuals.

            <description>As we say goodbye to 2023 and welcome 2024, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to think about the good and tough parts of the year. Not everything goes the way we want, but we can learn from both the good and bad experiences. I see 2023 as a year of making things better, like fixing the base of a building. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked my top five observations on foundational changes from this year, and some might continue into 2024.</description>
