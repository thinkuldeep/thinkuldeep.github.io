            <description>In a previous article, we explored how to build and use an Android app as an external commissioner to onboard Thread devices into a network. This article takes it a step further by demonstrating how to implement a Java-based external commissioner.
The thread commissioning process involves the following key steps:
 Discovering the Border Router Connecting to the Border Router Adding Joiner Rules Joining the Thread Network  In this guide, we will implement these steps in a Java application, providing a clear and structured approach to external commissioning in OpenThread.</description>

            <description>OpenThread Commissioner Implementation in Java OpenThread‚Äôs open-source project currently offers a native Commissioner CLI and an Android app for external commissioning, but no standalone Java-based implementation.
This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a step-by-step guide for developers to build an external Commissioner in Java.

            <description>As we say goodbye to 2023 and welcome 2024, it&amp;rsquo;s a time to think about the good and tough parts of the year. Not everything goes the way we want, but we can learn from both the good and bad experiences. I see 2023 as a year of making things better, like fixing the base of a building. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked my top five observations on foundational changes from this year, and some might continue into 2024.</description>
