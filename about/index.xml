            <description>My thoughtworkings The guiding thoughts that work for me In celebration of Thoughtworks&amp;rsquo; 30th anniversary, I am excited to launch this eBook featuring guiding thoughts from a diverse set of 30 thoughtworkers. These thoughts have resonated with me and shaped my journey within the organization and life.
This ebook is launched on my fifth anniversary at Thoughtworks. I believe this compilation of thoughts will not only serve as a personal reflection but also as a valuable resource for others on their own professional journeys.</description>
