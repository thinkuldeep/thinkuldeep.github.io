            <description>Almost a year ago, my book Exploring the Metaverse was launched globally—available at leading retailers including Amazon and BPB Online.
With forewords and testimonials from pioneers across industries, the book aims to demystify the Metaverse and provide a thoughtful lens on its technological, business, and societal implications. It&amp;rsquo;s been incredibly fulfilling to see it resonate with readers and spark meaningful conversations.
This milestone wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been possible without the unwavering support of Thoughtworks, our ecosystem partners, and—above all—my family, friends, and colleagues.</description>
