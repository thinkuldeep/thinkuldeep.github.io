            <description>Thoughtworks, Thoughtworkers, and books share a deep and enduring connection. Over the years, hundreds of books have been authored by Thoughtworkers, reflecting a culture rooted in thought leadership, learning, and knowledge sharing.
As part of this vibrant thought-sharing community, I recently had the privilege of launching my book 📕 Jagjeevan: Living Larger than Life at the Thoughtworks office and signing copies for colleagues. The moment was special—not just because it was a book launch, but because it was about sharing timeless life lessons and inspirations drawn from the life of my great-grandfather, lessons that feel especially relevant in today’s fast-paced world.</description>

            <description>Life teaches us lessons every single moment—but only when we pause to reflect do we truly grow. Everyone faces challenges; no life is free from problems. What defines us is not the struggle, but how we rise above it.
 Most challenges we encounter today are the same ones our previous generations faced—whether they relate to daily life, relationships, earning, spending, or navigating responsibilities. So much wisdom already exists around us, in our homes, in our traditions, in the stories of our elders.</description>

            <description>After a few hectic months, I recently visited a camping site with my family — a truly refreshing experience being close to nature. The trip was hosted by Camp Gopika and accompanied by Astrostop, adding a unique touch to our stay.
The serene environment gave me time to reflect on life and also work on the final touches of my upcoming book, 📕 “Jagjeevan – Living Larger than Life”, which tells the story of my great-grandfather and his belief that travel is essential for learning and introspection.</description>
