 The metaverse, a loosely defined term, has gone from a virtual game world to the next internet and sparks conversations on technology‚Äôs potential. Despite eye-rolling at terms like metaverse and eXtended Reality (XR), immersive technologies are silently becoming part of our daily life through social media, virtual collaboration, and digitized experiences. We seamlessly embrace digital tools, scanning codes, engaging in virtual trials, and altering reality through digital filters.</description>

In the past, it has been defined to suit the narratives of organizations and individuals alike. Some see it as a game, others as a virtual world, while some view it as a tool for global connection and collaboration.</description>

            <description>Metaverse is the most enquired word after Facebook renamed itself to ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù to align to their metaversal vision. However, the term ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù was coined 3 decade ago by Neal Stephenson, in his 1992 science-fiction novel ‚ÄúSnow Crash,‚Äù which envisions a virtual reality-based successor to the internet. In the novel, people use digital avatars of themselves to explore the online world, often as a way of escaping a dystopian reality.
Today, Metaverse is being considered as a $800 billion path with double digit growth in next 5 years, where industry is trying to get most out of it by co-creating with communities, and focusing on it‚Äôs cost-effective universal acceptance.</description>
